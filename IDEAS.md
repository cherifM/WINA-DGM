# WINA-DGM: Improvement Ideas and Future Work

This document outlines potential improvements and future directions for the WINA-DGM project based on the initial optimization results.

## Current Performance Summary

- **Best Sparsity**: 95.1% (excellent compression)
- **Best Accuracy**: 11.23% (needs improvement)
- **Best Fitness**: 0.3720 (generation 7)
- **Final Fitness**: 0.3636

## Model Architecture Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Network Design
```python
def create_enhanced_model():
    return nn.Sequential(
        # Consider adding convolutional layers for spatial features
        nn.Conv2d(1, 32, 3, padding=1),  # For MNIST (1 channel)
        nn.BatchNorm2d(32),
        nn.LeakyReLU(0.1),
        nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2),
        nn.Dropout(0.3),
        
        # Add more capacity
        nn.Linear(32*14*14, 512),
        nn.BatchNorm1d(512),
        nn.LeakyReLU(0.1),
        nn.Dropout(0.3),
        
        # Final layers
        nn.Linear(512, 128),
        nn.LeakyReLU(0.1),
        nn.Linear(128, 10)
    )
```

### 2. Advanced Activation Functions
- Try GELU, Swish, or Mish activations
- Layer-specific activation functions
- Parametric activations that evolve with the model

## Evolutionary Algorithm Enhancements

### 1. Dynamic Fitness Function
```python
def dynamic_fitness(accuracy, sparsity, generation, max_generations=10):
    # Gradually shift focus from sparsity to accuracy
    accuracy_weight = 0.5 + 0.5 * (generation / max_generations)
    return (accuracy_weight * accuracy) + ((1 - accuracy_weight) * sparsity)
```

### 2. Adaptive Mutation Rates
- Higher mutation in early generations for exploration
- Lower mutation in later generations for exploitation
- Layer-specific mutation rates

### 3. Population Management
- Increase population size (e.g., 50-100)
- Implement species formation
- Add age-based selection pressure

## Training Strategy Improvements

### 1. Progressive Pruning
```python
def progressive_pruning(epoch, max_epochs, final_sparsity=0.95):
    # Gradually increase sparsity
    if epoch < max_epochs // 3:
        return final_sparsity * 0.3  # Start with 30% of target sparsity
    elif epoch < 2 * max_epochs // 3:
        return final_sparsity * 0.6  # 60% of target sparsity
    else:
        return final_sparsity
```

### 2. Learning Rate Scheduling
- Cosine annealing with warm restarts
- Cyclic learning rates
- Layer-wise learning rates

### 3. Knowledge Distillation
- Use a pre-trained teacher model
- Distill knowledge to the sparse student model
- Combine with evolutionary optimization

## Advanced Sparsity Techniques

### 1. Structured Pruning
- Channel pruning
- Filter pruning
- Layer removal

### 2. Lottery Ticket Hypothesis
- Find winning tickets
- Iterative magnitude pruning
- Early-bird tickets

### 3. Adaptive Sparsity
- Layer-wise sparsity ratios
- Neuron importance estimation
- Dynamic sparsity allocation

## Evaluation and Analysis

### 1. Comprehensive Metrics

- Hardware-aware pruning

### 2. Model Formats
- ONNX export
- TensorRT optimization
- TFLite conversion

## Research Directions

1. **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**
   - Integrate with WINA-DGM
   - Search for optimal sparse architectures

2. **Multi-objective Optimization**
   - Pareto-optimal solutions
   - Accuracy vs. efficiency trade-offs

3. **Continual Learning**
   - Adapt sparsity during deployment
